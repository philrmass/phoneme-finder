# Phoneme Finder

### By Phil Mass

## Description

This application helps teach reading and writing by familiarizing the user with the phonemes that make up words. You can search for any word to get the phonmes, show in the IPA notation, the Arpabet, and a set of custom symbols I designed with my son to make the phonemes easier to remember. The symbols each have a shape (circle, square, triangle, diamond, hexagon, or star) and a color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, black, or white). The shapes are grouped into phoneme types and a reference is provided with sample words so you can quickly find the phoneme you need for a word. 

## Usage 

To use the website, choose a word that is somewhat unfamiliar, help the student to sound out the word, and then break it down into phonemes, writing down the symbol and color for each as you go. Once you think you've decoded the word, type it into the search bar to see if you are right. There are words that can be pronounced in several ways, and so have different phoneme spellings, so if you don't think the phonemes match, that could be the cause. Also, be aware that often there are fewer phonems than letters in a word, and occasionally there are more phonemes than words. So have fun and learn!
